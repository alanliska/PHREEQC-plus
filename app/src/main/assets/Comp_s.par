Gcorr for equation G* = G�+7.93 kJ.mol-1 (for compressing 1 mol gas std. state at 1 atm to 1 liter)
Hcorr for equation H* = H�+2.29 kJ.mol-1 (for compressing 1 mol gas std. state at 1 atm to 1 liter)
Scorr for equation S* = S�-18.9 J.K-1.mol-1 (for compressing 1 mol gas std. state at 1 atm to 1 liter)
(first block defines corrections for the compound, second block for the elements)
(When computing H, S, and G by MOPAC, it is necessary to compress the solution state of the calculated material, however, the constituent elements in Ref.txt are already in the 1M aqueous state, so there is no need to compress.)
(On the other hand, when performing the preorganized - tabulated - data conversion to a database, all the corrections are unneeded since the studied compound is already in the standard state.)
